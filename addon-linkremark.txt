This file is added just for convenience to pick it in file selection
dialog during loading of temporary extension in Firefox.
It is selected by default and creates a descriptive entry
in the list of recent documents.
This file allows to avoid choosing directory "background" by default.
Actually Firefox needs a directory (with manifest.json file)
but it asks for a file.
